This new release supports multiple languages.
The app itself can be translated and major words can be created in other languages using latinized alphabet.
The words can be listed in any number or all of the available languages.
The definitions of the words will be translated into the app's current language.
The offline English version should work the same (if app is in English and target language is only English).
It currently includes Spanish but later will automatically include French, German, etc..
